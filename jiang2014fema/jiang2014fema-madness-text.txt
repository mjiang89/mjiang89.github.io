Hi, my name is Meng Jiang and I am presenting FEMA - a new framework for user behavior analysis.  We noticed that user behaviors are multi-faceted and dynamic.  It brought us high sparsity and high complexity problems in modeling and pattern mining.  We developed an approximation algorithm to solve these problems in FEMA, which gives accurate results with little loss.  Come to our talk at one thirty in New York Ballroom West.
