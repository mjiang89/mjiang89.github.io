      "|00:01:17,680|The prototype was so heavy.|\n",
      "|00:01:23,920|It needed to be suspended from the ceiling by a mechanical arm for all that hardware.|\n",
      "|00:01:23,920|It could only display basic wireframe rooms that were barely explorable.|\n",
      "|00:01:32,320|But it was one of humankind's first experiments into replacing your real world with a digital reality since 1992.|\n",
      "|00:01:37,360|Many people have sought to fulfill the vision that sutherland wrote about over half a century ago.|\n",
      "|00:01:45,520|The ultimate display would be a room within which the computer can control the existence of matter.|\n",
      "|00:01:59,520|A chair displayed in such a room would be good enough to sit in handcuffs displayed in such a room would be confining and a bullet displayed in such a room would be fatal with appropriate programming.|\n",
      "|00:02:07,440|Such a display could literally be the wonderland into which alice walked on the mobile ar side again.|\n",
      "|00:02:20,240|This is how most of the world will experience augmented reality for the first time.|\n",

      "|00:04:28,160|Let's begin with shopping because it integrates seamlessly with the real world.|\n",
      "|00:04:40,160|AR has proven to be a powerful medium for shopping and retail air can let you try on a watch a shirt or a new shade of makeup.|\n",
      "|00:04:46,000|All without ever leaving your home but the top use case for AR shopping right now is furniture according to a few major studies.|\n",
      "|00:04:51,680|Furniture is the number one thing people want to shop for with AR.|\n",
      "|00:04:51,680|It's tough to know if a thousand dollar couch will be the right one for you.|\n",
      "|00:05:08,560|If you aren't sure it'll fit right in your living room or match your curtains, AR's unique ability to work within the world around us makes it easy to integrate digital versions of furniture right inside your house unlike 2d images which force you to imagine the object in your home.|\n",
      "|00:05:15,120|AR makes full use of 3d space letting you see the furniture at the exact size and dimensions of real life.|\n",
      "|00:05:25,440|Major furniture retailers like ikea and house have put ideas like this into practice with the option to purchase included directly within the application.|\n",
      "|00:05:31,200|When it comes to business, AR core enables experiences for many different kinds of professional organizations.|\n",
      "|00:05:37,760|Warehouses can build helpful navigations and instructions for workers.|\n",
      "|00:05:43,920|Architecture firms can display designs in 3d space.|\n",
      "|00:05:50,480|Retailers can give customers novel ways to engage with products and advertisers can reach consumers with immersive campaigns and this is just the tip of the iceberg.|\n",
      "|00:06:03,840|The power of ar is that it lets users build relationships with brands inside their physical spaces rather than trapped behind screens.|\n",
      "|00:06:09,680|One of the most obvious uses for.|\n",
      "|00:06:09,680|AR is social media and social sharing snapchat was the first media platform to fully embrace AR.|\n",
      "|00:06:21,600|The platform introduced lenses in 2015 building off the popularity of filters these allowed users to digitally augment and manipulate faces including that famous rainbow vomiting lens.|\n",
      "|00:06:27,120|Though many may not have thought of it this way, it is a lightweight expression of AR.|\n",
      "|00:06:40,400|Facebook also followed the lead with its own ar camerafx platform google is working to develop an intuitive platform for creating content for social AR.|\n",
      "|00:06:48,880|Through AR stickers stickers allow users to import animated and interactive 3d objects for use in social media.|\n",
      "|00:07:10,000|Although the usability is still being fully explored air devices and smartphones are able to pull off some truly one-of-a-kind entertainment experiences in 2016 pokemon go became the first viral ar game since then we've seen the launch of similar games from mainstream franchises like harry potter the walking dead and ghostbusters and we'll see many more in the coming years.|\n",
      "|00:07:15,840|But location-based adventure games like these are only one possible game application for AR.|\n",
      "|00:07:24,080|We're also seeing development in genres ranging from arcade to tabletop games as well as some types of games that have never existed before.|\n",
      "|00:07:30,560|It's also worth noting that while pokemon go was popular.|\n",
      "|00:07:30,560|It also wasn't full ars.|\n",
      "|00:07:46,320|It just overlaid flat 2d images on the real world creatures in that initial launch of pokemon go didn't behave the way they would if they were actually in your physical space instead they floated on your screen and only looked properly embedded in the environment if you line them up with the ground.|\n",

      "|00:08:41,840|AR is an educational experience designed to help teachers show students information with augmented reality and education is even a broader category than the classroom.|\n",
      "|00:08:49,200|AR will allow us to create training environments where we can measure and incorporate information in real time.|\n",
      "|00:09:14,000|AR is already used in medicine and that will only increase as the technology matures doctors and nurses are using air's enhanced visualization capabilities to more successfully diagnose patients plan procedures and execute treatment plans 3d visuals offer much more for these doctors to learn in comparison to 2d visuals and interactive 3d visuals like the ones in AR experiences offer even more.|\n",
      "|00:09:20,880|AR could one day replace traditional charts or guide surgeons through complex operations.|\n",
      "|00:09:40,080|One step at a time medical science is one of the most exciting areas for ar to impact both today and tomorrow the one thing all of these arenas have in common is their need for new and better AR content.|\n",
      "|00:09:40,080|That's where tools like air core and future creators like you come into play.|\n",
      "|00:09:52,720|Non-profits can use AR to help build brand identity and encourage deeper engagement around critical issues.|\n",
      "|00:09:57,840|For example, say an organization wants to educate the public about the impacts of climate change.|\n",
      "|00:10:19,360|They could give a presentation in front of a few hundred people or they could create an ar experience that lets millions of smartphone users view what their own backyards might look like amid an extreme drought or flood allowing audiences to see the real world effects of systemic problems makes AR a powerful strategy for non-profits and other social impact organizations to enhance their messaging.|\n",
      "|00:10:32,880|This week we will focus on the state of AR who's behind it how effective is the technology what hurdles need to be overcome where can I buy it.|\n",
      "|00:10:32,880|These are the questions you'll learn in module 2.|\n",
      "|00:10:43,600|There are a few basic rules that augmented reality creators need to remember about the way objects behave in AR.|\n",
      "|00:10:43,600|These behaviors are the key to merging the real and digital world seamlessly.|\n",
      "|00:10:50,960|The first of these behaviors is place stationary ar objects need to stick to one point in a given environment.|\n",
      "|00:11:12,560|This could be something concrete such as a wall floor or ceiling or it could be suspended somewhere in midair whatever the case placing means these objects stay where they're positioned even when users are in motion the mug on your coffee table doesn't jump around when you move your head if you look away.|\n",
      "|00:11:17,600|It's right there when you look back again for AR to maintain the illusion of reality digital objects need to behave in the same way real ones do.|\n",
      "|00:11:29,840|In addition to sticking wherever they are placed in the real world, AR objects need to be able to scale.|\n",
      "|00:11:29,840|Think about it like this when a car is coming towards you from the distance.|\n",
      "|00:11:45,760|It starts out small and gets bigger a painting viewed from the side looks very different when you walk around and face it head-on our physical distance from a given object and our orientation around it changes how they appear to us.|\n",
      "|00:11:50,960|A well-constructed AR experience will incorporate objects that are not only appropriately placed but will look different if you stand right next to it.|\n",
      "|00:12:04,000|Below it above it or view it from afar, this is scaling together placing and scaling are what take AR objects from digital novelties to assets that could potentially replace real-world counterparts.|\n",
      "|00:12:17,440|Occlusion refers to what happens when an image or object is blocked by another move your hand in front of your face like this you've just occluded the computer screen with your hand.|\n",
      "|00:12:27,920|However imagine if you moved your hand in front of your face and the screen was still visible.|\n",
      "|00:12:27,920|You'd probably get a little concerned.|\n",
      "|00:12:33,280|AR objects have to play by the rules of occlusion if we want them to seem real.|\n",
      "|00:12:38,960|This means that AR hardware has to not only understand where the object is in the room but also its relative distance from the user compared with any other object physical or digital.|\n",
      "|00:12:50,480|Occlusion means hiding virtual objects behind other virtual objects and ones in the real world say you move behind a wall while using AR.|\n",
      "|00:12:56,080|If you still see the AR objects it will break your sense of immersion that sense of AR objects actually being in the real world in the app seamless.|\n",
      "|00:13:06,320|Occlusion requires constant recalibration as users can move in any direction at any given moment which is why it's one of the trickiest aspects of building successful AR content.|\n",
      "|00:13:12,320|We'll talk later about the ways that this is currently a technical constraint in mobile AR.|\n",
      "|00:13:20,000|That developers need to consider in their apps just like a real world object.|\n",
      "|00:13:26,480|Objects in AR need to respond to different patterns of lighting to make sense in our minds.|\n",
      "|00:13:32,720|The colors shading and shadows cast by these objects all need to behave properly both in the initial lighting of a scene and in the case of a lighting change.|\n",
      "|00:13:43,440|For example, if you dim the lights during an ar experience then the ar objects should change in color and shading appearance similarly if you move an object around.|\n",
      "|00:13:51,600|The shadows need to move accordingly just like they would in real life.|\n",
      "|00:13:51,600|AR objects need to appear solid.|\n",
      "|00:13:58,000|This may sound obvious but it takes conscious effort to achieve as you engage with and ultimately create AR content keep this in mind.|\n",
      "|00:14:06,320|AR objects should never overlap with real world objects nor should they appear to be floating in thin air, if they're not something like an airplane or balloon.|\n",
      "|00:14:11,360|If either of these missteps is in your app, it will break immersion for your users.|\n",
      "|00:14:25,360|The final component of realism context awareness is the most difficult to achieve as we discussed in the last video.|\n",
      "|00:14:31,600|AR hardware has to be aware of essentially every single object in its environment.|\n",
      "|00:14:31,600|It needs to understand that there is a desk a chair and a table next to a bookcase.|\n",
      "|00:14:43,040|A vase and a television and it needs to know which of these items is taller shorter fatter or wider than the others and how this changes when the subject moves around in space.|\n",
      "|00:14:48,400|That's a lot to track generating this awareness quickly and without a drop in the digital object's fidelity.|\n",
      "|00:15:00,240|Smoothness or functionality is one of the biggest challenges facing AR creators today companies like google are investing in software tools like AR core to help address some of these issues.|\n"
