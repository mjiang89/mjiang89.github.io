1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:08,640
The term 'augmented reality' was first coined in 
1992 by thomas caudell and david mizell.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,880
Two engineers worka on a simple see-through headset 
that aided airplane engineers in complex wiring schematics.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,760
According to their documentation, the 
goal of augmented reality commonly abbreviated as 
AR was to enable cost reductions and efficiency 
improvements

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,560
in many of the human involved operations
in aircraft manufacturing.

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,520
We've been dreaming about 
the potential of AR for a long time

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,440
and the history of the medium stretches 
back before we even had a term for it

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:48,160
In fact AR shares a history with its technological 
cousin virtual reality both virtual reality

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:57,920
or VR and AR share a common ancestor the sword of 
damocles built in 1968. 

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,400
The sword of damocles was created by computer scientist and researcher 
ivan sutherland his goal was to 

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,960
create the ultimate display a digital interface capable of 
transforming the physical world. 

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,680
The prototype was so heavy. It needed to be suspended from the 
ceiling by a mechanical arm for all that hardware

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,920
It could only display basic wireframe rooms 
that were barely explorable.

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:32,320
But it was one of humankind's first experiments into replacing 
your real world with a digital reality since 1992.

14
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,360
Many people have sought to fulfill the vision 
that sutherland wrote about over half a century ago.

15
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:45,520
The ultimate display would be a room within 
which the computer can control the existence of matter.

16
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,160
A chair displayed in such a room would be 
good enough to sit in handcuffs displayed in such

17
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:59,520
a room would be confining and a bullet displayed 
in such a room would be fatal with appropriate
programming.

18
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:07,440
Such a display could literally be the 
wonderland into which alice walked on the mobile
ar side again.

19
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:14,320
This is how most of the world will 
experience augmented reality for the first time

20
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,240
In fact the rapid development of smartphones 
has actually contributed to the growth of
the vr and ar industries.

21
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:28,000
That's because the same 
components that make smartphones work gyroscopes.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,480
Accelerometers miniaturized high-resolution 
displays are also required for AR and VR headsets.

23
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,480
The high demand for smartphones has driven the 
mass production of these components throughout
the past 10 years,

24
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,840
resulting in greater 
hardware innovations and decreases in costs.

25
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,000
In the most basic sense AR is created using the 
front and rear facing cameras on your phone. 

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,160
You hold it up and your screen is able to display 
digital objects and information integrated
within your real world.

27
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:07,840
Your phone can now act like 
a portal to new worlds experiences and information.

28
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,360
Google's first foray into the ar space was 
google glass a head mounted display that
took the form of smart glasses.

29
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,760
It is still used today in a variety of 
enterprise applications after glass.

30
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,240
Google's next ar play was project tango. 
Tango was a combination of custom software

31
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:38,960
and additional hardware for unique depth sensing 
smartphones. Tango enabled phones could track

32
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:44,560
the world around them and as a result. We're 
capable of rendering unique digital overlays

33
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:52,720
onto the real world in 2017. Google announced 
AR core an evolution of the tango platform.

34
00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:01,360
AR core is an application programming interface 
or api for building and developing mobile AR.

35
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:08,160
Experience by the end of this course you'll 
have familiarity with how augmented reality works

36
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:17,360
as well as basic workflows in ar core. It's a young 
medium augmented reality. It is already being used

37
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,320
in a variety of different capacities. In this 
section we'll look at a few of the most popular.

38
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,160
Let's begin with shopping because it integrates 
seamlessly with the real world. AR has proven to

39
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,560
be a powerful medium for shopping and retail 
air can let you try on a watch a shirt

40
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,160
or a new shade of makeup. All without ever leaving your 
home but the top use case for AR shopping right now is

41
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,000
furniture according to a few major studies. 
Furniture is the number one thing people want to

42
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,680
shop for with AR. It's tough to know if a thousand 
dollar couch will be the right one for you.

43
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,200
If you aren't sure it'll fit right in your living 
room or match your curtains, AR's unique ability

44
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,080
to work within the world around us makes it easy 
to integrate digital versions of furniture right

45
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,560
inside your house unlike 2d images which force you 
to imagine the object in your home. 

46
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,120
AR makes full use of 3d space letting you see the furniture 
at the exact size and dimensions of real life.

47
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,240
Major furniture retailers like ikea 
and house have put ideas like this

48
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,440
into practice with the option to purchase 
included directly within the application.

49
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,200
When it comes to business, AR core enables 
experiences for many different kinds of
professional organizations.

50
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:37,760
Warehouses can build helpful navigations
and instructions for workers.

51
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,920
Architecture firms can display designs in 3d space. 
Retailers can give customers novel ways to engage

52
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:50,480
with products and advertisers can reach consumers 
with immersive campaigns and this is just the tip
of the iceberg.

53
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,000
The power of ar is that it 
lets users build relationships with brands

54
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,840
inside their physical spaces rather than trapped 
behind screens. One of the most obvious uses for

55
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,680
AR is social media and social sharing snapchat 
was the first media platform to fully embrace AR.

56
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,480
The platform introduced lenses in 2015 building 
off the popularity of filters these allowed users

57
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,600
to digitally augment and manipulate faces 
including that famous rainbow vomiting lens.

58
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,120
Though many may not have thought of it this 
way, it is a lightweight expression of AR.

59
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,680
Facebook also followed the lead with its own ar 
camerafx platform google is working to develop

60
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,400
an intuitive platform for creating content for 
social AR. Through AR stickers stickers allow users

61
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:48,880
to import animated and interactive 3d objects 
for use in social media. Although the usability

62
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,600
is still being fully explored air devices and 
smartphones are able to pull off some truly

63
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:00,080
one-of-a-kind entertainment experiences in 
2016 pokemon go became the first viral ar game

64
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,600
since then we've seen the launch of similar games 
from mainstream franchises like harry potter

65
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,000
the walking dead and ghostbusters and 
we'll see many more in the coming years.

66
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,840
But location-based adventure games like these 
are only one possible game application for AR.

67
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,960
We're also seeing development in genres 
ranging from arcade to tabletop games

68
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,080
as well as some types of games 
that have never existed before.

69
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,560
It's also worth noting that while pokemon go was 
popular. It also wasn't full ars. It just overlaid

70
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,000
flat 2d images on the real world creatures 
in that initial launch of pokemon go didn't

71
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,040
behave the way they would if they were actually in 
your physical space instead they floated on your

72
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,320
screen and only looked properly embedded in the 
environment if you line them up with the ground.

73
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,160
Demonstrating complex subjects is another one 
of AR's greatest capabilities allowing learners

74
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,760
to engage with spatial content visualize right 
in front of them to that end google launched an

75
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,840
AR application for education expeditions. AR is an 
educational experience designed to help teachers

76
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,720
show students information with simple and engaging 
ar visuals for example students can explore a

77
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,960
strand of dna inspect the statue of david or 
even witness an intense category 5 hurricane.

78
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,560
Spatial learning allows students to engage with 
3d content directly rather than having to imagine

79
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,400
it while reading a textbook google's expeditions.
AR is an educational experience designed to help

80
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,960
teachers show students information with augmented 
reality and education is even a broader category

81
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,840
than the classroom. AR will allow us to create 
training environments where we can measure and

82
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:49,200
incorporate information in real time. AR is already 
used in medicine and that will only increase

83
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,760
as the technology matures doctors and nurses are 
using air's enhanced visualization capabilities

84
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,160
to more successfully diagnose patients 
plan procedures and execute treatment plans

85
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,680
3d visuals offer much more for these 
doctors to learn in comparison to 2d

86
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:14,000
visuals and interactive 3d visuals like 
the ones in AR experiences offer even more.

87
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,880
AR could one day replace traditional charts 
or guide surgeons through complex operations.

88
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,960
One step at a time medical science is one of 
the most exciting areas for ar to impact both

89
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:33,440
today and tomorrow the one thing all of these 
arenas have in common is their need for new

90
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:40,080
and better AR content. That's where tools like air 
core and future creators like you come into play.

91
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,520
Non-profits can use AR to help build brand 
identity and encourage deeper engagement

92
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,720
around critical issues. For example, say an 
organization wants to educate the public about

93
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,840
the impacts of climate change. They could give 
a presentation in front of a few hundred people

94
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,280
or they could create an ar experience that 
lets millions of smartphone users view

95
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,320
what their own backyards might look like 
amid an extreme drought or flood allowing

96
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,160
audiences to see the real world effects of 
systemic problems makes AR a powerful strategy

97
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,360
for non-profits and other social impact 
organizations to enhance their messaging.

98
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,680
This week we will focus on the state of AR who's 
behind it how effective is the technology what

99
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,880
hurdles need to be overcome where can I buy it. 
These are the questions you'll learn in module 2.

100
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,240
There are a few basic rules that augmented reality 
creators need to remember about the way objects

101
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,600
behave in AR. These behaviors are the key to 
merging the real and digital world seamlessly.

102
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,960
The first of these behaviors is place stationary 
ar objects need to stick to one point in a given environment.

103
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:56,880
This could be something concrete 
such as a wall floor or ceiling or it could be

104
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,320
suspended somewhere in midair whatever the case 
placing means these objects stay where they're

105
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,440
positioned even when users are in motion the 
mug on your coffee table doesn't jump around

106
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,560
when you move your head if you look away. It's 
right there when you look back again for AR to

107
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,600
maintain the illusion of reality digital objects 
need to behave in the same way real ones do.

108
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,480
In addition to sticking wherever they are placed 
in the real world, AR objects need to be able to

109
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,840
scale. Think about it like this when a car is 
coming towards you from the distance.

110
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,800
It starts out small and gets bigger a painting viewed from 
the side looks very different when you walk around

111
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,400
and face it head-on our physical distance from 
a given object and our orientation around it

112
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,760
changes how they appear to us. A well-constructed 
AR experience will incorporate objects that

113
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,960
are not only appropriately placed but will look 
different if you stand right next to it. 

114
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:58,480
Below it above it or view it from afar, this is scaling 
together placing and scaling are what take AR

115
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,000
objects from digital novelties to assets that 
could potentially replace real-world counterparts.

116
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:12,320
Occlusion refers to what happens when an image 
or object is blocked by another move your hand

117
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,440
in front of your face like this you've just 
occluded the computer screen with your hand.

118
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,720
However imagine if you moved your hand in front 
of your face and the screen was still visible

119
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,920
You'd probably get a little concerned. AR objects 
have to play by the rules of occlusion if we want

120
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,280
them to seem real. This means that AR hardware has 
to not only understand where the object is in the

121
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,960
room but also its relative distance from the user 
compared with any other object physical or digital.

122
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,480
Occlusion means hiding virtual objects behind 
other virtual objects and ones in the real world

123
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,480
say you move behind a wall while using AR. If you 
still see the AR objects it will break your sense

124
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,080
of immersion that sense of AR objects actually 
being in the real world in the app seamless.

125
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,920
Occlusion requires constant recalibration as users 
can move in any direction at any given moment

126
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,320
which is why it's one of the trickiest 
aspects of building successful AR content.

127
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,480
We'll talk later about the 
ways that this is currently

128
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,320
a technical constraint in mobile AR. That 
developers need to consider in their apps

129
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:20,000
just like a real world object. Objects in AR need 
to respond to different patterns of lighting to

130
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,480
make sense in our minds. The colors shading and 
shadows cast by these objects all need to behave

131
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,720
properly both in the initial lighting of a scene 
and in the case of a lighting change. 

132
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,520
For example, if you dim the lights during an ar experience 
then the ar objects should change in color and

133
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:43,440
shading appearance similarly if you move an object 
around. The shadows need to move accordingly just

134
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:51,600
like they would in real life. AR objects need to 
appear solid. This may sound obvious but it takes

135
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,000
conscious effort to achieve as you engage with 
and ultimately create AR content keep this in mind.

136
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,960
AR objects should never overlap with real 
world objects nor should they appear to

137
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,320
be floating in thin air, if they're not 
something like an airplane or balloon.

138
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,360
If either of these missteps is in your 
app, it will break immersion for your users.

139
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,320
The final component of realism context awareness 
is the most difficult to achieve as we discussed

140
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,360
in the last video. AR hardware has to be aware 
of essentially every single object in its

141
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,600
environment. It needs to understand that there 
is a desk a chair and a table next to a bookcase.

142
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,360
A vase and a television and it needs to know 
which of these items is taller shorter fatter or
