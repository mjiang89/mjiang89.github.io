Hi, my name is Meng Jiang and I am presenting CatchSync - a new graph algorithm for detecting fraudulent behavior.  We noticed that social graphs often have unnaturally spiky degree distributions.  So, we developed a new algorithm to detect users who act suspiciously synchronized.  Our algorithm has caught millions of accounts with high precision.  Come to our talk at ten thirty in Empire West.
