The development of social networks has enabled the collection of behavioral data of unprecedented size and complexity. All social platforms have realized that great scientific and marketing values are contained in the millions of billions of behavioral records. How can we model users’ behaviors in social networks? What are the basic characteristics of their complex behaviors? How can we design our models for accurate behavior prediction and detection in social applications such as recommender systems, personalized search and social marketing? In this tutorial, we answer these questions - uncovering the contextual dependency, cross-domain and cross-platform properties, synchronized and abnormal characteristics, and many other patterns of users’ behaviors. We introduce recent advances in modeling complex behaviors from the perspectives of individuals, groups and cascades in social networks. Finally we summarize the tutorial with discussions on open issues and challenges about behavior modeling in social networks.
